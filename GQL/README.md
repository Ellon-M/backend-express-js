-- GraphQL APIs --

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime
for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data

GraphQL is typically served over HTTP via a single endpoint which expresses the full set of capabilities of the service. 
This is in contrast to REST APIs which expose a suite of URLs each of which expose a single resource.
